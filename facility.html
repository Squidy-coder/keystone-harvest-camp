                Here at our rural town of Keystone, we have one of the largest harvest camps in the US,
                with five-hundred square meters of area, in order to take care of each of the 
                hundreds of kids who arrive at our harvest camp on a daily basis. With such a vast amount
                of land at our harvest camp, we are sure that your child will find an activityu that they enjoy!
                (more information below).
