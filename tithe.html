            <p>
                Here at Keystone, we value all tithes who come to our harvest camp and, thus,
                that is why our tithing program is one of the most prestine and state of the art
                in the country. Depending on which faith you and your tithe follows, we are sure
                to provide your child with a staff member who practices the same religion and follows
                our CARE protocols. For only a measly price of $100,000, your child can experience one of
                the best times of their lives in our special title dormitories and in the services we provide
                in these special dormitories (more information below).    
            </p>
