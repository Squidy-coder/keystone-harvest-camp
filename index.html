        <h3>About Our Mission</h3>
        <div id="mission" class="content_seg">
            <img id="happy_teens" src="./Pictures/istockphoto-1432740995-612x612.webp" width="50%" alt="happy_teens">
            <p>
                Here at rural Keystone harvest camp, our mission is as simple as the daily lives of
                the people who inhabit this town. Our mission can be remembered as the acronym CARE.
                Each letter in the acronym stands for Compassionate, Aware, Reliable, and Enthusiasm.
                In order to provide the upmost care for each child living on our facilities, it is important
                that each staff member is compassionate towards each child on their transition to a divided
                state, aware of a child's location at all times to ensure that no child shall be injured by an accident
                or injured by other children in our care, be reliable to the needs of achild under our care,
                and always shows enthusiasm towards their job to ensure a child under our care will feel comfortable
                and welcome before they enter a divided state.
            </p>

        <h3>Historical Significance</h3>
        <div id="historical" class="content_seg">
            <img id="rushmore_sculpture" src="./Pictures/25157aac4695c2eda279a891bdf4e231--mount-rushmore-historical-pictures.jpg" width="50%" alt="rushmore_sculpture">
            <p>
                While we enjoy taking pride in our prestine facilities and compassionate faculty,
                we also tend to take pride in our historical location. Over a century ago, between
                October 4, 1927, and October 31, 1941, a great sculptor by the name of Gutzon Borglum
                and a team of 400 workers sculpted the grand 60 foot high carvings of famous United States 
                Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln
                right here at the rural town of Keystone to represent the first 150 years of American history.
                Now, over a century later, we value that your child shall learn such history about our little
                rural town and the memorial on the side of Mount Rushmore. It not only shall benefit your child
                by increasing their knowledge on US history, but also shall benefit others after your child
                transitions form their whole state.
