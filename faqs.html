        <h3>Will My Child Be Safe From The Potential Bullying and Harassment of Others?</h3>
        <div id="main_intro" class="content_seg">
            <h4>Answer:</h4>
            <p>
                Here at keystone, it is our upmost duty and responsibility to formally ensure you that
                our staff shall always prioritize any child from being harassed at our peaceful harvest camp.
                If our staff do witness any form of bullying or harassment upon one child by another, then the
                child who commited such acts that go against all policies of safety at this harvest shall be 
                severly punished. However, I can assure you that such punishments are not harming any troublesome
                child in any way.

        <h3>Will My Child Be In Severe Pain During The Process of Unwinding?</h3>
        <div id="mission" class="content_seg">
            <h4>Answer:</h4>
            <p>
                Absolutely not! It is every harvest camp's policy to always ensure a child has a completely
                pain free experience during this process.
            </p>

        <h3>Will My Tithe Be Separated From The Other Regular Unwinds?</h3>
        <div id="historical" class="content_seg">
            <h4>Answer:</h4>
            <p>
                The answer is yes. We understand that your tithe is at a higher risk of harassment than others, and
                such harassment is a concept that our staff will never accept becoming into reality as long as our CARE
                protocol remains in place. This protocal also ensures that your tithe will never be corrupted by one of
                the more "troublesome" kids.
